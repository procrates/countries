## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

Using apis can be hard when they are structured badly, so I learned to thourghly go through the data and plan how to get and display the data.

First time I used dark toggle mode to allow users to display the site with their systems visual settings and also be able to toggle the variants.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about the different futures of Nuxt 3, especially the workflow of getting data and using the server to do it.

I want to start using composables more often to create a cleaner codebase, for now I am comfortable using global state managment.
